# Ola_Data_Analyst_project

## project overview:
This project analyzes Ola’s ride data to identify demand trends, optimize driver allocation, and improve operational efficiency. It focuses on peak ride times, high-demand zones, and customer behavior. By examining trip patterns, cancellations, and wait times, the goal is to provide actionable insights to enhance service delivery. The analysis uses tools like Python, SQL, and Tableau for data exploration and visualization. Predictive modeling is applied to forecast future demand and support strategic decision-making.

## Objectives:
Analyze Ola ride data to uncover trends in demand, optimize driver allocation, and improve customer satisfaction through data-driven insights.

## Reports:
This project analyzes Ola ride data to uncover demand patterns, optimize driver allocation, and reduce cancellations. Peak ride demand occurs between 6–9 PM in urban zones, especially on weekends. High cancellation rates are linked to long wait times and driver unavailability. Using SQL, and Powerbi key trends were visualized, and predictive models were developed to forecast demand. Customer segmentation revealed different usage patterns and potential churn risks. 

## Conclusion:
The analysis provides valuable insights into ride demand and operational challenges. By implementing the recommendations, Ola can improve customer experience, reduce cancellations, and increase operational efficiency.
